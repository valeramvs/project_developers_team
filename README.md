# project_developers_team
The program is created for clients, managers and team of developers. A client introduces a specification
with tasks. Tasks have information about number of developers for every task and their qualification.
A manager gets the specification with tasks and finds free appropriate developers for every task.
Each developer sets necessary work time for solving the task. The manager counts the bill according to
developer's qualification and work time. Final bill is introduced to the client by the manager.
All information store in the database. Connection with DB occurs by JDBC.
